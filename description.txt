Limitation : The API provided does not have enough information to tell or score the most purchased item. 
This is the output from when I access the available columns with pandas: 
	Index(['order_id', 'date_created', 'total_amount', 'status'], dtype='object') 
Maybe the API had been edited prior to this test. Please kindly verify this. 

Description: I did my rough rough work in the seed.py file.


Note: this is a test app and hence subjected to fine tuning and correction on security and other advanced issues…
